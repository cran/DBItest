#' @details
#' The two most important functions are \code{\link{make_context}} and
#' \code{\link{test_all}}.  The former tells the package how to connect to your
#' DBI backend, the latter executes all tests of the test suite. More
#' fine-grained test functions (all with prefix \code{test_}) are available.
