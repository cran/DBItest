\value{
\code{dbListTables()}
returns a character vector
that enumerates all tables
and views
in the database.
Tables added with \code{\link[=dbWriteTable]{dbWriteTable()}}
are part of the list.
As soon a table is removed from the database,
it is also removed from the list of database tables.

The same applies to temporary tables if supported by the database.

The returned names are suitable for quoting with \code{dbQuoteIdentifier()}.
An error is raised when calling this method for a closed
or invalid connection.
