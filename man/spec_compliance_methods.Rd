\section{DBI classes and methods}{

A backend defines three classes,
which are subclasses of
\link[DBI:DBIDriver-class]{DBI::DBIDriver},
\link[DBI:DBIConnection-class]{DBI::DBIConnection},
and \link[DBI:DBIResult-class]{DBI::DBIResult}.
The backend provides implementation for all methods
of these base classes
that are defined but not implemented by DBI.
All methods defined in \pkg{DBI} are reexported (so that the package can
be used without having to attach \pkg{DBI}),
and have an ellipsis \code{...} in their formals for extensibility.
